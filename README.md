# [Labs] We don't assign issues

This repository contains a GitHub workflow allowing to send a message in an issue by simply attaching a "we don't assign issues" label to the issue.

The label will be automatically deleted right-after.

You can see the process in https://github.com/Open-reSource/labs-we-don-t-assign-issues/issues/3.
